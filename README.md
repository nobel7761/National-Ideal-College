## Give Permission to Collaborate On Existing Repo:

- go to the repo
- settings 
- collaborators
- add people
- provide username or full name or email
- select the user from the suggestion 
- Add "user" to this repository

## After Receive Permission Steps I have to merge all branches: 

- collaborate 
- accept invitation 
- git branch branchName 
- git checkout brachName 
- make change to your code 
- git add .7.git commit -m "as you need " 
- git push --set-upstream origin branchName 
- git merge branchName 
- git pull 
- git push
